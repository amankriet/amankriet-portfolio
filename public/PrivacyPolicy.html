            MADS Calculator: Privacy policy

            Welcome to the MADS Calculator app for Android!

            This is an open source Android app developed by Aman Kumar. The source code is available on GitHub. The app is also available on Google Play.

            As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

            I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data like username and password is only for test purpose 
            and accepts any random username. Also, the calulation history stores only last 10 calculations and all previous calculations are automatically 
            removed. created by the you is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

            If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, 
            please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

            Yours sincerely,
            Aman Kumar.
            Varanasi, India.
